# Drug-Classification

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify drugs based on various patient metrics. It utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, along with comparative analyses using Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Nearest Class Centroid (NCC) classifiers. The project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in predicting drug types based on patient characteristics.

### Features

- Implementation of SVM with linear kernel.
- Cross-validation strategy to evaluate SVM performance.
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction.
- Comparative analysis with KNN and NCC classifiers.
